<p>Hi, I am Dominic.
I achieved my Bachelors and Masters in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Manchester. 
There I was an active member of the student society community, where I was the President of the Engineers Without Borders Society and founder of the Manchester Consulting Society.
I believe that kickstarted my passion for merging my technical and social skills to create products and services that are user focused.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I have started full-time at <a href="https://www.yieldbook.com/">The Yield Book</a>, an LSEG company, as part of the Product Management team leading the European ABS Product initiative.
My main responsibility is to interact with all internal and external stakeholders in order to expand our advanced securitised analytics to the global market.
Some notable achievements of the last year are:  
</p>
<ul class="achievement-list">
<li> the release of default adjusted analytics with collaboration with NUS.</li>
<li> the expansion of the European focused team by 5x.</li>
<li> the creation of new country risk indices that make LSEG's country risk classification 3x more comprehensive. </li>
</ul>
