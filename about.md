<p>Hello!
I am Dominic!
I got my Bachelors and Masters in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Manchester. 
There I was very active in the student society community, by either being a member, leading or founding many socities.
I believe that kickstarted my passion for merging my technical and social skills to create products and services that are user focused.
</p>

<p>
Recently I have started full-time as part of <a href="https://www.yieldbook.com/">The Yield Book</a>, an LSEG company, as part of the Product Management team leading the European ABS Product initiative.
My main responsibility is to interact with all internal and external stakeholders to expand our advanced securitised analytics to the global market.
Some notable achievements of the last year are:  
</p>
<ul class="achievement-list">
<li> the release of default adjusted analytics with collaboration with NUS.</li>
<li> the expansion of the European focused team by 5x.</li>
<li> created new country risk indices that make LSEG's country risk classification 3x more comprehensive. </li>
</ul>
